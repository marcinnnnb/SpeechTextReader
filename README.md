# SpeechTextReader

Based on course '20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript' created by Brad Traversy (https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/), I would like to present a project 13/20: Speech Text Reader.

A text to speech app for non-verbal people. Pre-made buttons and custom text speech. This project uses the Web Speech API.
